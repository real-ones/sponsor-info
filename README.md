Patreon makes it a bit easier, so I have probably already contacted you!

### Repository Info
This repository will be kept updated with clean code, if you find anything that is not up to standards, please leave an issue. Then we can have a conversation about it, and update it if necessary!

I will be trying to add some new content every month. But it might reach a point where it will slow down due to maintenance, big flutter updates, etc

And in case I haven't already thanked you individually....
### Thank you so much!! Your support is absolutely unbelievable. ❤️
